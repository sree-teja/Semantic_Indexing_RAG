### ✅ 1. **Implement File Type Expansion**

**Goal:** Support a wider range of input document types beyond plain text or PDFs.

* Add support for `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, and HTML.
* Use libraries like `python-docx`, `pandas`, and `beautifulsoup4` for parsing.
* Auto-detect file type and apply the correct loader before vectorization.

---

### ✅ 2. **Integrate Advanced Chunking and Metadata Storage**

**Goal:** Improve semantic search accuracy and context relevance.

* Implement hierarchical or adaptive chunking based on section headers or semantic similarity.
* Store metadata like section titles, page numbers, and timestamps alongside embeddings.
* Display source metadata in query responses to enhance traceability.

---

### ✅ 3. **Add UI for Index Management and Querying**

**Goal:** Make the tool user-friendly for non-technical users.

* Build a Streamlit or Gradio interface for:

  * Uploading documents
  * Creating/deleting vector indexes
  * Semantic querying with context display
  * Switching between local models
* Add dropdown for selecting models and chat personalities.

---

### ✅ 4. **Enable Hybrid Search (Vector + Keyword)**

**Goal:** Combine the power of semantic similarity with keyword matching.

* Fuse dense vector search (e.g., via `FAISS`) with sparse keyword search (e.g., `BM25` via `Whoosh` or `ElasticSearch`).
* Implement reranking of top results using LLM-based relevance scoring (e.g., using `rerank` from `LangChain` or `Cohere`).

---

### ✅ 5. **Add Incremental Index Updates**

**Goal:** Avoid full reindexing when only a few documents are added or updated.

* Detect modified or new documents via checksums or timestamps.
* Update only the changed embeddings and metadata in the vector store.
* Provide a CLI or button to trigger incremental updates.
